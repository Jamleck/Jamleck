ðŸ‘‹ About me

I am Jamleck Nyaga, a Lead Software Engineer and Team Lead at [Caterpillar Inc](https://www.caterpillar.com/). My primary focus is on backend development and distributed systems using .NET, but my passion for technology drives me to explore and learn new skills continually.

I like shaping teams and developing strategies that incrementally deliver value by leveraging the power of technology and teamwork. As a volunteer of the [DDD Perth conference](https://dddperth.com/) I help build a strong local technology community.

Originally from Kenya, I now reside in Perth, Australia, and have a love for travel and photography.
